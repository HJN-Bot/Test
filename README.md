# HJN-Bot / Test

This repo is used by Sam (OpenClaw) to deliver outputs.

## Folders
- `deliverables/` — PPTs, docs, weekly reviews, shareable assets
- `learning/` — learning notes/summaries (YouTube/articles/courses)
- `projects/` — project notes (CER, dashboard, XHS, etc.)

## Workflow
- Drafts and outputs are committed with clear dates and titles.
- If something needs your confirmation, Sam will ask before writing to Airtable.
